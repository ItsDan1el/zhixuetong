## About
The ZhiXueTong APP is an application made to let Student's in the WFL schools practice their oral English. However, the original app is very buggy so I made this version to make the app more user-friendly.

------
## Download
The APP is certainly in early-development stage, but you can download the APP and help us test out features and find bugs.

### Dependency
This APP requires Java enviroment. The Java version must be Java8 or above. To check your Java version, do `java -version` in CMD (For Windows)
or Terminal for mac.

[Download Java](https://www.java.com/en/)

## Running
_I don't have a Linux computer so I don't know how to get jar files to work on Linux_

### Mac
#### Normal Way
1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/ItsDan1el/zhixuetong/releases/download/v0.1/zhixuetong_v0.1.0.jar) of the APP.
2. Double-click the `.jar` file if you have Java installed, if not, install java and do it again.
3. If a warning shows up telling you it's downloaded from the internet and it might be not safe or something, click ok and go to `system preferences/securaty and privacy/general` and click `open anyways`
4. The APP should open.
#### Trouble Shooting
1. Redo the things above
2. Restart your computer
3. check Java version (needs to be Java8 or above)
4. check the default opening application
5. Try starting it with terminal
    1. open terminal
    2. drag the file to desktop
    3. use command `cd desktop`
    4. then use command `java -jar <filename>.jar`
    5. then it should open
